# Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The project leverages **vectorization methods** (e.g., TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer) to generate recommendations based on user preferences or content similarity.

## üöÄ Features

- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similarity of features such as genres, descriptions, or keywords.
- **Vectorization**: Utilizes vectorization techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical representations.
- **Efficient Recommendations**: Provides recommendations with high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Can be extended to incorporate user ratings or collaborative filtering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for building the system.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms and techniques for recommendation.
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For vectorization and similarity computation.
  - `pandas`: For data handling and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `streamlit` (optional): For creating a simple user-friendly UI.

## üìÇ Dataset

The system uses a dataset containing movie information such as:
- **Title**: The name of the movie.
- **Genres**: Categories the movie belongs to.
- **Overview**: A brief description of the movie.

You can use publicly available datasets like the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) or any custom dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates.
   - Text data (e.g., genres, overview) is preprocessed (e.g., lowercased, stopwords removed).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Vectorization methods (e.g., TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer) are used to transform text data into numerical vectors.

3. **Similarity Computation**:
   - Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between movies.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the similarity scores, the top `n` movies are recommended.
